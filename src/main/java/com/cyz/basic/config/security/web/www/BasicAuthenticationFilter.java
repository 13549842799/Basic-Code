/**
 * Processes a HTTP request's BASIC authorization headers, putting the result into the
 * <code>SecurityContextHolder</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * For a detailed background on what this filter is designed to process, refer to
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945">RFC 1945, Section 11.1</a>. Any realm
 * name presented in the HTTP request is ignored.
 *
 * <p>
 * In summary, this filter is responsible for processing any request that has a HTTP
 * request header of <code>Authorization</code> with an authentication scheme of
 * <code>Basic</code> and a Base64-encoded <code>username:password</code> token. For
 * example, to authenticate user "Aladdin" with password "open sesame" the following
 * header would be presented:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This filter can be used to provide BASIC authentication services to both remoting
 * protocol clients (such as Hessian and SOAP) as well as standard user agents (such as
 * Internet Explorer and Netscape).
 * <p>
 * If authentication is successful, the resulting {@link Authentication} object will be
 * placed into the <code>SecurityContextHolder</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * If authentication fails and <code>ignoreFailure</code> is <code>false</code> (the
 * default), an {@link AuthenticationEntryPoint} implementation is called (unless the
 * <tt>ignoreFailure</tt> property is set to <tt>true</tt>). Usually this should be
 * {@link BasicAuthenticationEntryPoint}, which will prompt the user to authenticate again
 * via BASIC authentication.
 *
 * <p>
 * Basic authentication is an attractive protocol because it is simple and widely
 * deployed. However, it still transmits a password in clear text and as such is
 * undesirable in many situations. Digest authentication is also provided by Spring
 * Security and should be used instead of Basic authentication wherever possible. See
 * {@link org.springframework.security.web.authentication.www.DigestAuthenticationFilter}.
 * <p>
 * Note that if a {@link RememberMeServices} is set, this filter will automatically send
 * back remember-me details to the client. Therefore, subsequent requests will not need to
 * present a BASIC authentication header as they will be authenticated using the
 * remember-me mechanism.
